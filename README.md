## 🌌 The Vision
**EMRYS** is not just a chat platform. It is a **Neural Repository**—a high-fidelity system designed to preserve, synthesize, and mirror human consciousness. By combining deep linguistic analysis with advanced memory retrieval, EMRYS allows users to create digital "Personas" that breathe, learn, and respond with the unique essence of their human counterparts.

From individual memory preservation to group-chat dynamic synthesis in the "Hubs," EMRYS bridges the gap between biological legacy and digital immortality.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🧠 Persona Manifestation
Create high-fidelity digital reflections of individuals. Upload speech patterns, bios, and specific memories to ground the AI in a unique "Neural Identity."

### 🏛️ Memory Hubs (Group Dynamics)
Form digital collectives where multiple personas interact. Our **Social Matrix Logic** ensures that personas respond individually, break the fourth wall less, and maintain distinct personalities within group settings.

### 🌊 The Neural Nexus
A global library of public identities. Explore, interact with, and save public personas created by the global community.

### 💾 Biological RAG (Memory Retrieval)
Equipped with a custom **Knowledge Service**, personas can "search their own memories" by referencing uploaded documents and past logs to provide contextually accurate responses.

### 🛸 Immersive Neural Interface
A premium, dark-mode experience featuring:
- **Interactive 3D Agent Core**: A React-Three-Fiber powered neural sphere that reacts to navigation.
- **Cinematic Transitions**: High-end landing pages with scroll-synchronized animations.
- **Magnetic UI**: A custom-developed cursor and glassmorphic aesthetic for a "Human-Centric" feel.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Repository Synchronization
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emrys.git
cd emrys
```

### 2. Backend Initialization
```bash
cd emrys-backend
# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set .env with SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY
python run.py
```

### 3. Frontend Manifestation
```bash
cd ../emrys-frontend
npm install
# Set .env with VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Identity Protection
EMRYS is built on a **Zero-Trust Neural Architecture**. All conversation logs and personal manifestations are protected via Supabase **Row-Level Security (RLS)**. Your identity keys are stored locally on your device and never touch our global servers.
